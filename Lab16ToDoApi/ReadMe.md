# Lab 16: Intro to APIs

An exploration in .Net Core Api building

## Getting Started

This is a small test app using visual studio 2017. You will need to install and run VS2017 in order to run and use the app.
Packages used:
.Net Core

## Features

Using both of the resources above, create an API in .NET Core that conducts the standard HTTP verbs (Get,Put,Post,Delete) for a "To-Do" list. Your "To-Do" list will consist of indivudal tasks that can be saved into the database and extracted as needed. You sould also have the ability to get all of the tasks by a simple get request.
